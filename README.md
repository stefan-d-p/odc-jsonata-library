# OutSystems Developer Cloud JSONata External Logic Library

JSONata is a powerful JSON transformation and manipulation DSL. JSONata is very helpful to transform JSON documents that
cannot be directly serialized to OutSystems structures. For example dictionary based structures with dynamic key values.

This ODC external logic library based on the [C# implementation of Mikhail Bark](https://github.com/mikhail-barg/jsonata.net.native)
allows you to perform complex JSON transformations and manipulations directly from your OutSystems Logic flows.

For transformation examples read [Transform JSON data with JSONata in OutSystems](https://without.systems/transform-json-data-with-jsonata-in-outsystems).

This component is directly available from OutSystems Developer Cloud Forge.
